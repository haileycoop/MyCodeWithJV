# Revised Course: Server Structure, Stack, and DevOps for Multiplayer Game Deployment

## Learning Context

### Experience level

You are a beginner coder with some knowledge of JavaScript and experience with tools like GitHub, VS Code, and the terminal on macOS.

### Larger goal

You want to focus on server structure, stack, and DevOps to be able to set up and deploy a simple multiplayer JavaScript game that uses Socket.IO. The game itself can be minimal and serves as a demonstration of the deployed system. Your main objective is to establish a smooth deployment workflow.

### Key constraints

- Browser-based: The game should be browser-based without requiring any downloads.
- Performance and Lightweight: The system should be optimized for performance, especially on older computers and browsers.
- Security: It should avoid triggering security issues within corporate IT environments.
- Scalability: The focus is on setting up a system for dedicated app instances with fewer than 30 users and between 2 and 10 concurrent users.
- Beginner-friendly: Opt for beginner-friendly workflows with fewer steps and use tools like Vite instead of more complex setups like Webpack.

## Revised Course Overview

### Course Duration

Approximately 6 weeks

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the server structure and stack necessary for deploying a multiplayer JavaScript game.
- Set up a development environment with the required tools and frameworks.
- Implement Socket.IO for real-time communication between the game client and server.
- Establish a smooth deployment workflow using beginner-friendly tools.
- Optimize the system for performance, security, and scalability within the given constraints.

## Module 1: Server Setup and Development Environment (Duration: 2 weeks)

- Introduction to server structure and stack for multiplayer game deployment.
- Setting up a development environment with tools like Node.js and a code editor.
- Exploring beginner-friendly tools like Vite for quick setup and configuration.
- Implementing a simple JavaScript game client to demonstrate the system.

## Module 2: Real-time Communication with Socket.IO (Duration: 2 weeks)

- Understanding the fundamentals of real-time communication and the role of Socket.IO.
- Setting up a Socket.IO server to handle client-server interactions in the multiplayer game.
- Implementing Socket.IO in the JavaScript game client for real-time updates and player interactions.
- Testing and debugging the Socket.IO implementation for smooth communication.

## Module 3: Deployment and DevOps Workflow (Duration: 2 weeks)

- Exploring different deployment strategies for a multiplayer game.
- Configuring a cloud hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify) for easy deployment.
- Automating deployment using beginner-friendly DevOps tools like GitHub Actions or Netlify CI/CD.
- Optimizing the deployment workflow for efficiency, security, and scalability.
- Testing and ensuring the smooth deployment of the multiplayer game.

### Projects and Assessments

Throughout the course, you will work on practical projects and assessments that focus on implementing the server structure, setting up the development environment, integrating Socket.IO, and deploying the multiplayer game. These projects will provide hands-on experience and assess your understanding of the concepts covered in each module.
