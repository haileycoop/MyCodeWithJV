# Javascript Context problem

## Overview

- I've run into a problem that seems like a recurring gap in my code knowledge that is also hard for the AI to parse
- I want to build a mini course around skilling myself up on this aspect of Javascript so I can better troubleshoot it

## Problem as posed in the AskJV discord channel

Hi @JV - I am very stuck on an issue that I think maybe ChatGPT is bad at diagnosing.

The issues is in this file:

https://github.com/haileycoop/phaser-test/blob/main/src/main.ts

In the handleDrag function, it first checks to see if this.room evaluates to true. It wants to know whether a room exists on the server before attempting to send state to the server

For some reason, in the context of handleDrag, this.room evaluates to undefined

Whereas within the oncreate() function, this.room evaluates to true and outputs json in the console

I've run into this before with chatGPT. It gives lots of very hacky workarounds to try and known of them work.

I feel like there's some JS fundamentals I'm lacking about context and why this.room would evaluate one way in create() and another way in handleDrag()

What should I learn to try to fix this?

You can quickly view the app here: https://haileycoop-phaser-test.netlify.app/

But since the Colyseus server only exists on my local, you won't be able to replicate the issue (you won't be able to make this.room evaluate to true at all)

## Prompt for a new channel with the AI

### Experience level

Hello. I am a beginner coder, but I have some ability with github, VS code, and terminal on mac. I have mostly learned javascript.

### Problem with Javascript contex

I seem to run into a similar problem quite often in Javascript. I think it has to do with the concept of "context" but I am not sure.

It might be that some variable is evaluating to true in one context, but false or falsey in another. And I can't understand why this would be the case.

Also, when I ask for support from the AI assistant, it often cannot easily solve this problem for me. It seems to be missing some ability to see the larger system.

### Specific example - room.id in main.ts

I am providing a specific example. I am not asking you to solve this specific code problem or write new code. Please do not try to rewrite the code and do not suggest solutions. Remember that you are an AI tutor.

My hope is that providing a specific example will make you more likely to steer me towards the right learning.

In this example, main.ts is a file that is part of Phaser.js game app. It contains most of the game logic. It interacts with another file within the server called MyRoom.ts, which is part of the Colyseus multiplayer server framework.

Main.ts initiates the game, and then asks MyRoom.ts to create a new game room. MyRoom.ts and the Colyseus code will generate a new game room and assign it a configuration. This is stored in main.ts as `this.room`. This is provided back to main.ts.

In the oncreate() function of main.ts, room.id evaluates to true as expected, which is proven by the fact that it logs out the room details in the browser console.

Further down in the file, there is a function called handleDrag(). The function is called when the user drags a box around on the screen.

As part of handleDrag, it sends the updated position of the box to the Colyseus server via MyRoom.ts, so that other players will then see those changes to the position of the box.

Before it attempts to send the box position, it first checks if this.room evaluates to true. In the current code, it evaluates to undefined. Therefore the position is not sent to the server.

I do not understand why it evaluates to true in one context, and to undefined in another.

#### Current main.ts code

[Full code was provided to the AI, which is this file on June 3rd, 2023 - https://github.com/haileycoop/phaser-test/blob/main/src/main.ts]

### Learning goal - understand the underlying rules of Javascript that cause this

While I would love to solve this issue one time, it is more important to me to understand what causes it in the first place, so I can avoid or fix it in the future.

First, please summarise the key concepts in play in this problem.

Then design a course that will help me learn those concepts.

# Course: Understanding JavaScript Context and the 'this' Keyword

Thanks for your detailed explanation and sharing the context around your problem. From your description, it seems the key concept in play here is JavaScript's 'context' or 'this' keyword, and how it behaves differently in various situations. In JavaScript, the value of 'this' depends on how a function is called, which can be confusing.

Given the code snippet you've provided, it appears that the context of 'this' might be changing from the 'GameScene' class to another context, which is why 'this.room' becomes undefined in the 'handleDrag()' function. This situation could be due to how JavaScript treats the 'this' keyword inside event handlers or callbacks, or due to the way Phaser.js sets up the game and handles interactions.

For a deep understanding of these concepts, I propose the following course outline:

## Module 1: JavaScript Basics and Advanced Concepts

## 1. Understanding Programming Paradigms

_Understanding the different programming paradigms will give you a more versatile set of tools for solving programming problems, as different paradigms are suited to different types of tasks._

Programming paradigms are established models or styles of programming that have distinct features and methods for structuring and organizing code. They provide a way to conceptualize how the code you write interacts and relates to other pieces of code.

There are multiple programming paradigms, and different languages are designed to follow specific paradigms, although many modern languages are multi-paradigmatic. Here are a few common paradigms:

- **Procedural Programming**: This is one of the oldest paradigms, used by languages like C and Pascal. It organizes code into procedures, which are just blocks of code that optionally take in inputs (parameters) and return outputs.

- **Object-oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used by languages like Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript, this paradigm organizes code into objects, which contain data (properties) and functions (methods).

- **Functional Programming**: In this paradigm, used by languages like Lisp, Haskell, and also available in JavaScript, code is organized into functions, and there is a heavy emphasis on immutability and avoiding shared state.

- **Declarative Programming**: In this paradigm, rather than explicitly instructing "how" to achieve something (the control flow), you specify "what" you want to achieve. SQL and HTML are good examples of declarative languages.

Remember, these paradigms are not mutually exclusive, and often, a single piece of software will incorporate elements of multiple paradigms. JavaScript, for example, is a multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## 2. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

_This section introduces the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and lays the foundation for the upcoming sections, where we will delve deeper into each of these principles._

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and software. These objects represent real-world entities or concepts, making OOP a highly intuitive and practical approach for many applications.

In the context of programming, an **object** is an entity that combines two main components:

- **Properties**: These are data or variables that belong to the object. For example, a `Car` object might have properties such as `color`, `brand`, and `model`.

- **Methods**: These are functions that belong to the object. These methods represent the behaviors or capabilities of the object. For instance, a `Car` object might have methods such as `drive()`, `park()`, or `refuel()`.

In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which can be thought of as blueprints for creating objects. However, JavaScript takes a slightly different approach, which we'll discuss later in this book.

The main principles of OOP are **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**:

- **Encapsulation**: This principle is about bundling the data (properties) and the methods that manipulate the data into a single unit known as an object. Encapsulation also involves hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through the object's methods.

- **Abstraction**: This involves creating simple models of more complex real-world objects. The idea is to reduce complexity by exposing only the necessary details of an object to the outside world.

- **Inheritance**: This is a mechanism where you can create a new class as a modified version of an existing class; this makes it easier to reuse and recycle code.

- **Polymorphism**: This principle allows you to use an entity in multiple forms. For instance, if you have a `Parent` class and a bunch of child classes (`Child1`, `Child2`, etc.), each with a method of the same name, polymorphism allows you to use the method of a `Child` class even when you treat the child instance as an instance of the `Parent` class.

These four principles make code easier to manage, more flexible, and more maintainable. They also help improve the efficiency of collaboration on large projects.

## 3. Overview of OOP in JavaScript

_This section provides a high-level overview of how JavaScript uses the concepts of object-oriented programming. We'll go into each of these concepts in more detail in the coming chapters._

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming. It's important to note that JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language, but a prototype-based one. This means that in JavaScript, objects inherit functionality from other objects, via their prototypes, as opposed to most class-based languages where objects are defined by classes, and classes inherit from other classes.

Here's a basic overview of how object-oriented programming is handled in JavaScript:

- **Objects**: Everything in JavaScript is an object (except for primitive data types - undefined, null, boolean, number, and string). Objects in JavaScript can be thought of as collections of properties.

- **Properties**: In JavaScript, a property is a variable that is attached to an object. Properties can hold values of any type, including other objects, which allows for building complex data structures.

- **Methods**: Methods in JavaScript are properties that hold function values.

- **Prototype**: Each JavaScript object has a link to a prototype object. When trying to access a property that does not exist in an object, JavaScript tries to find this property in the prototype of this object.

- **Constructor function**: This is a regular function used as a constructor to create objects using the `new` keyword. The constructor's name usually starts with a capital letter to distinguish it from other, non-constructor functions.

- **`this` Keyword**: In JavaScript, `this` is a special variable that’s created for every execution context (every function). It gives you access to the object a method is called on, or the object a constructor function is used to create.

- **Inheritance and the Prototype Chain**: Inheritance in JavaScript is based on prototypes. The prototype object of any object can be viewed as its "parent". If a property is not found on the current object, JavaScript will look up the prototype chain until it either finds the requested property or reaches an object with a null prototype.

The way JavaScript handles OOP is quite different compared to languages like Java, C++, or Python. But it gives JavaScript a lot of flexibility and makes it incredibly powerful.

## 4. Object and Property Creation in JavaScript

_This section provides a brief overview of how objects are created in JavaScript and how properties can be added to them. We'll delve into these topics in more detail in the next chapters._

JavaScript provides multiple ways to create objects and add properties to them. Here's a quick overview:

### Object Literals

The simplest way to create an object in JavaScript is by using an object literal, which is defined within curly braces `{}`. Within the braces, properties and their values are defined as `key: value` pairs, separated by commas.

```javascript
let dog = {
  name: "Fido",
  breed: "Labrador",
  age: 5,
};
```

In this example, dog is an object with properties name, breed, and age.

### Constructor Functions

Constructor functions are used to create multiple similar objects. The convention is to capitalize the function name.

```javascript
function Dog(name, breed, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.age = age;
}

let fido = new Dog("Fido", "Labrador", 5);
```

In this example, Dog is a constructor function that constructs dog objects. We create a new dog instance by using the new keyword.

## Object.create Method

The Object.create method is used to create a new object and set its prototype to a specified object.

```javascript
let animal = {
  species: "Animal",
  describe: function () {
    return `This is a ${this.species}.`;
  },
};

let dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.species = "Dog";
```

In this example, dog is an object with animal as its prototype. The dog object inherits the describe method from animal.

### Adding Properties to Objects

Properties can be added to objects even after they've been created. This can be done directly, or through the object's prototype.

```javascript
dog.color = "Black"; // Adds a new property 'color' to 'dog'
```

In this example, we add a color property to the dog object. Now the dog object has a color property in addition to species.

These are just a few ways to create objects and properties in JavaScript. Depending on the situation, one method may be more suitable than others. In the following sections, we'll discuss when to use each method, and explore more features and capabilities of objects in JavaScript.

## 5. Defining Methods in JavaScript

Methods are functions that are associated with an object. They represent behaviors or actions that an object can perform. In JavaScript, methods can be defined in multiple ways. Let's explore some of these:

### Method Definition in an Object Literal

You can define methods directly within an object literal by associating a key with a function value.

\```javascript
let dog = {
name: 'Fido',
breed: 'Labrador',
age: 5,
bark: function() {
console.log('Woof!');
}
};

dog.bark(); // Output: 'Woof!'
\```

In this example, `bark` is a method of the `dog` object.

### Method Definition in a Constructor Function

Methods can also be defined within constructor functions.

\```javascript
function Dog(name, breed, age) {
this.name = name;
this.breed = breed;
this.age = age;
this.bark = function() {
console.log('Woof!');
}
}

let fido = new Dog('Fido', 'Labrador', 5);
fido.bark(); // Output: 'Woof!'
\```

In this example, every `Dog` instance we create with the constructor function will have its own `bark` method.

### Method Definition Using the Prototype

You can add methods to the prototype of an object. All instances of that object will then have access to that method.

\```javascript
function Dog(name, breed, age) {
this.name = name;
this.breed = breed;
this.age = age;
}

Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
console.log('Woof!');
}

let fido = new Dog('Fido', 'Labrador', 5);
fido.bark(); // Output: 'Woof!'
\```

In this example, the `bark` method is added to the `Dog` prototype, so all `Dog` instances have access to it. This is a more memory-efficient way of adding methods, as each instance doesn't have its own copy of the method.

Remember that JavaScript objects are dynamic and you can add or remove methods even after an object has been created. The way you define methods may change based on the requirements of your code.

# Pivot: focus on execution context

I never actually read the above. It sort of dropped in that execution order / context was the issue. I went onn a walk with the dog and listened to some videos. This one was good:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd9VaW0M7K4

This let me frame the problem to the AI better. I had it summarise the execution order of main.ts for me.

It started recommending approaches but also cautioned that Phaser has its own lifecycle management approach.

I asked it to read this page of Phaser notes and recommend an approach:

https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/scene/

That got it to create code that worked immediately.

I asked it to write an assessment to test what I had just learned. See below. I got 100% but I had to think about it.
