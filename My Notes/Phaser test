# Phaser test

## Plan

- Get a basic phaser game working with vite
- Maybe follow one of the phaser tutorials with a relevant game type
- If all goes well, move on to making a multiplayer test

## Notes

### First attempt at deploying using someone else's vite template for phaser and typescript

- https://github.com/ubershmekel/vite-phaser-ts-starter
- decided to go with typescript since it seems strong on avoiding errors, which is a big focus for me (even if it costs more effort up front)
- got it working on local pretty easily but got a typescript error when trying to build. something wrong in the template code
- so then I commented out the broken bit and partially overwrote it with the example from getting started with phaser example
- this could build and be previewed, but I wasn't able to successfully deploy it using the github action .yml file supplied by the template developer
- thinking of trashing this attempt and starting over with a vite typescript template and building up my own approach
- might take some clues from this https://saricden.com/how-to-setup-a-phaser-3-project-with-vite
